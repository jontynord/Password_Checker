# Password_Checker
Python code to check if your password has been breached before. This code makes use of transforming the password into hash code, sending the hash code to the "Have I been pwned" website and grabbing the results from the website. By using this code it prevents the website to save your password as it is only the hash code that it is receiving.

When running the code in your terminal, call the file name and enter your password directly after in the terminal :)
